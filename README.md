# Distributed-Lab2

Setup Instructions:

- git clone
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install haskell-platform (This should install everything needed)
- cd Distributed-Lab2
- chmod +x compile.sh (may not be needed, but I was required to do it)
- ./compile.sh
- chmod +x start.sh (again may not be needed)
- ./start.sh [portnum]
- Clients can connect via 'telnet [host-ip-address] [portnum]'
